{% blogPosts "To Explore or Not to Explore : That is the Question", "By: Princess Stella","Many people would say that exploring the unknown is a scary challenge. I like to think otherwise. Our entire galaxy as we know it is a nearly incomprehensible concept. Millions upon millions of miles of pure darkness. For me, the dark and fear if the unknown has never frightened me. When I left NinthFive for the first time, it was on a school field trip over to NinthFourth. It didn't take long to arrive because we rode the AstroBus3560. It was when I looked at out the window to see the moons, stars, and other planets that I knew I was MEANT to be an interstellar explorer. They don't call me Stella for no reason." %}
