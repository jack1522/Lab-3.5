{% blogPosts "Walk a Lightyear in My Shoes", "By: Princess Stella","5.88 trillion miles. That is it. That is the number used to define the distance light can travel in just one year. To think about how much land can be covered during this time is insane. That is why it is my goal to life a life where I can travel and explore the galaxy freely. I yearn to travel the distance of many lightyears during my lifetime. I know that there must be so much more beyond my home galaxy NinthFive." %}
